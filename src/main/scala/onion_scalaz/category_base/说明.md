# category基础说明

category的构成有Compose/Endo/Category/Associative

## Compose

compose hints the morphism could compute from one end to the next end ,

and we can compute it by a sepcification order which one morphism's target end is

another morphism's origin

## Category

Category comparing to Compose has a key role that one was oneself's the target


## Endo

Endo is a useful morphism that one is going to oneself


## Associative

Associative explains one rule that the compose can change direction


## Conclusion

In a word, Category包含了Compose 自我映射的id 以及 associative(交换律)
